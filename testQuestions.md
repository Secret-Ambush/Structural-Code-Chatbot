## ✅ **📄 Document-Based Clause Lookup**
Try these after uploading or placing documents in the `data/` folder:

1. **“Which clause in ACI 318 discusses the flexural strength of reinforced concrete beams?”**  
2. **“What are the detailing requirements for T-beams?”**  
3. **“Is there any commentary available for Clause 8.4?”**  
4. **“List the minimum reinforcement requirements in Eurocode for slabs.”**  
5. **“Explain the durability requirements in IS 456.”**

## ✅ **🧮 Structural Calculator Agent**
These questions test your moment capacity calculator:

6. **“Calculate the moment capacity of beam B1 using b=300, d=500, fc=30, As=1800.”**  
7. **“What is ϕMn if b=250, d=450, fc=25, As=1500?”**  
8. **“Give me the nominal moment for b=400, d=600, fc=40, As=2200.”**

## ✅ **🌍 Web Search Agent (SerpAPI)**
These should trigger a web search if not answered locally:

9. **“What are the latest changes in ACI 318-19?”**  
10. **“Are there any international standards for prestressed concrete slabs?”**  
11. **“Compare ACI and Eurocode crack control requirements.”**

## ✅ **🧠 Mixed Reasoning / Agent Delegation**
These test multi-tool interaction:

12. **“Design a simply supported beam according to ACI with fc=30 and As=1800. What's its capacity?”**  
13. **“According to ACI, is a 250mm deep slab sufficient for a 6m span?”**  
14. **“Find clause about minimum clear cover and calculate for a beam with 25mm bars.”**
